## Practice 6 - PSSR - Search of Backtracking with constraints.

PSSR
## Description Of Problem

In this PSSR we use algorithms of backtracking search, we will search a combination of variables with domains that satisfy a Serie of constraining’s, the algorithm is util when the nodes must to obedience some conditions and the conjunct of conditions make the graph a system of constraining that need be verified with care because we can get a Serie of conditions with bad results because some nodes cannot get a domain.
The career of Systems Engineering of the Bolivian Catholic University organizes every year an event that
lasts a whole week where he invites national and international speakers to give talks on topics
interesting and relevant in the area of informatics.
The areas are: 
_ Computer Security (Seguridad Informatica)
 _ Software Engineering (Ingenieria De Software)
 _ Artificial Intelligence (Inteligencia Artificial)
The talks in the three areas are held in parallel.
The talks are from Monday to Friday, from 9 to 12 and from 15 to 18 hours.
The Conditions are:
_ The speakers chose his schedules.
_ Two speakers can’t take the same hour and day for an area but they can if the area is different In the same hour and day.
_ A speaker only can give 5 speeches.
_ Not always
_ Two international speakers can’t talk the same time although they give different areas.
